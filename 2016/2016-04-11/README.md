## Python in the Digital Technologies subject at NZ secondary schools

**Ian Stewart** presented examples of using python as part of the New Zealand 
Secondary Schools, **Digital Technologies** subject which is a component of 
the National Ceritificate of Educational Achievement (NCEA) levels 1 to 3.

For the slide show refer to the file: */ncea presentation/Python for NCEA units.odp*.

Also included are a series of circle_x.py programs. These are to demonstrate 
levels of complexity in python programming techniques.

The NCEA Level3 Digital Technologies Unit 91637 is titled **Develop a complex 
computer program for a specified task**. 

An example of a program that might meet this specification is the file 
*/prime_number/prime_number_locater.py*. 

There are also two other prime number locator programs which may be of 
interest *prime_number_locater_minimal_recursion.py* and *prime_number_rabinmiller.py*.
