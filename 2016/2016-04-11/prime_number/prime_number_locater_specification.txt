Explanatory Notes

1 This achievement standard is derived from Level 8 of the Technology learning area in The New Zealand Curriculum, Learning Media, Ministry of Education, 2007; and is related to the material in the Teaching and Learning Guide for Technology, Ministry of Education at http://seniorsecondary.tki.org.nz.

Further information can be found at http://www.technology.tki.org.nz/.

2 Develop a complex computer program for a specified task involves:
* designing and implementing a program that includes variables, an indexed data structure, and a modular structure including details of the procedural structures of the modules
* including a working graphical user interface with different sources of event generating components and event handling, and using classes and objects to encapsulate data and methods
* setting out the program code clearly and documenting the program with comments
* testing and debugging the program to ensure it works on a sample of expected input cases.

Skilfully develop a complex computer program for a specified task involves:
* using well-chosen modular and procedural structures, scope and encapsulation for data and methods, graphical user interface and event handling mechanisms
* documenting the program with variable and module names and comments that accurately describe code function and behaviour
* following a disciplined design and implementation process, with documented cycles of incremental development and comprehensive testing process, to ensure that the program works on inputs that include both expected and boundary cases.

Efficiently develop a complex computer program for a specified task involves:
* ensuring that the overall modular and procedural design, graphical user interface, and event handling design, are a well-structured, logical decomposition of the task, and that the program is flexible and robust
* setting out the program code concisely and documenting the program with comments that explain and justify decisions
* comprehensively testing and debugging the program in an organised and time effective way to ensure the program is correct on expected, boundary and invalid  input cases.

3 The programming language for this standard must be a text-based Object-oriented programming language that supports graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and event based programming.

4 The platform for the program could be a personal computer, a mobile device, or a web browser.  The program must involve graphical elements such as widgets, images, and/or shapes, and must respond to event based input from the user.

5 A complex computer program is one that has a modular structure; an indexed data structure (eg array or list); input and output; procedural structures that combine sequential, conditional, and iterative structures; a graphical user interface and event handling; and that includes classes and objects.  Inheritance is not required.

6 Any code that is auto-generated by an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) cannot be used as evidence of student code.

7 A specified task refers to a set task which requires the development of a complex computer program to resolve.  The task must be of sufficient rigour to allow the student to meet the standard and needs to be agreed prior to the program being developed.  It may be teacher-given or developed in negotiation with the student.
