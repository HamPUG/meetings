# Art of Python

## Presentation Slide show

* `art_of_python.opd`

A LibreOffice Impress presentation slide show. The objective of this presentation is to help with educating those who are new to writing python programs. It demonstrates how a python program should have a good structure and how to evaluate the quality of a program. It should also highlight that having a GUI does not guarantee a superior program over a console terminal based program. The four programs used in the presentation all achieve the same objective of calculating the area of a circle when supplied the radius. The program files are as follows.


## Files
* `circle_01.py`. A simple command line program.

* `circle_02.py`. A simple tkinter GUI program.

* `circle_03.py`. A more complex command line program.

* `circle_04.py`. A more complex tkinter GUI program.
