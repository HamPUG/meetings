* **Peter Reutemann** will [demo some basic ways of manipulating audio files](pydub) using the [Pydub](http://pydub.com) library.

* **Ian Stewart** will revisit the [Paramiko](https://github.com/HamPUG/meetings/tree/master/2020/2020-07-13/paramiko) library, 
which implements the SSHv2 protocol and offers client and server functionality.

* **Ian** has recently been writing python code using the GTK GUI library. He presented some [GTK Bits and Pieces](https://github.com/HamPUG/meetings/tree/master/2020/2020-07-13/gtk). These snippets of code may come in handy if you are writing a GTK python program.
