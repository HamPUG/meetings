* The Laby application (https://sgimenez.github.io/laby/) is designed to help
  you learn programming languages and this includes the Python language. The
  programs you write need to guide an ant through a labyrinth full of rocks and
  spider webs until the ant gets to the escape door. Ian Stewart will demonstrate
  some of the code that he has written in Python for his ant ([presentation](laby)).

* Peter Reutemann got annoyed at his laptop dock always reverting the audio
  settings on Linux, so he decided to see whether it was possible to manipulate
  pulseaudio from Python. The result: a bunch of command-line tools and a
  tray-icon application for managing profiles ([presentation](pulseaudio)).
