# 2020-12-14 Meeting

Let's do something a bit different for our last meeting this year: Python games! 
Lawrence came across a repository of free Python games aimed at education and fun (https://github.com/grantjenks/free-python-games). 

Together we can have a play and a nosy under the hood of the games themselves.
