    "What is the point of these? Let us start by considering some built-in functions that are commonly used as decorators for methods inside classes. In other languages (like Java or C++), it is possible to declare methods “static”. That means the method can be invoked via the class name itself, rather than via an instance of the class. Such methods still have access to the innards of the class, even though they have no “`this`” instance that they can reference.\n",

    "    #end MyClass\n",
    "\n",
    "However, because Python has no class visibility controls (e.g. `public`, `private`, `protected`), such a feature is more of a minor convenience for grouping purposes, rather than providing any really important functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is somewhat more useful is the `classmethod()` function. Whereas a regular method gets the current class instance as its first argument on a call, a classmethod gets the class object itself."
