# Wordle Assistant

*Wordle*, a daily website-based word puzzle, has become popular since its release in October 2021.

Ian Stewart presented his Python program [wordle_assistant.py](wordle_assistant.py), which is a tool designed to assist in solving a wordle puzzle.

Ian's slide show presentation is available in both [odp](wordle\ assistant.odp) or [pdf](wordle\ assistant.pdf) formats.
