Mathematics is often seen as a closed book by many people. However, with an easy to read programming language, like Python, it is possible to make mathematical fields such as number theory more approachable and even fun.
Computers provide recursion ...with no effort. In some cases a mathematical theory may be explored with a simple Python program that quickly covers all possibilities and their outcomes. A tedious task if it was to be done manually.

Ian Stewart will demo his take on Kaprekar's constant (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6174_(number)).

Lawrence D'Oliveiro will show you some fun things with continued fractions, such as approximating Pi.

[Peter Reutemann](fractals) will combine simple formulas with complex numbers to generate some fractals.
