There are different ways of adding dynamism to pages coming from your Web server. You may have heard of “AJAX” (“asynchronous JavaScript and XmlHttpRequest”). The next level beyond that is called “WebSockets”, which creates a server connection that allows for an ongoing stream of messages in both directions, to implement a live, continuously-updating Web page.
