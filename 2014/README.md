# 2014 Meetings

## [2014-02-24](2014-02-24) Initial Meeting of Hamilton Python User Group

Initial get together and discussion of format as a Python Users Group.

## [2014-03-10](2014-03-10) Established HamPUG Regular Monthly meeting

General discussion

## [2014-04-14](2014-04-14) Wordle and R's Wordcloud

Using Python to scrape all the song lyrics from a particular artist (from lyricsfreak.com) and then create a word cloud from all those lyrics using either using Wordle or using R's wordcloud package. The idea was to get a visual representation of the words that were said the most by a particular band or artist.

## [2014-05-12](2014-05-12) IDLE

IDLE is the Integrated DeveLopment Environment for Python. It is normally included with a Python distribution.

## [2014-06-09](2014-06-09) Editors and IDE's

We continue with our journey on exploring editors and IDEs that can be used for Python development: Ninja IDE, Spyderlib, Cat, Komodo, Textmate, Sublime, Eric.
Furthermore, Grace will be talking about the most common mistakes that people make when developing with Python.

Note: First month of using Meetup.com

## [2014-07-14](2014-07-14) Common Mistakes

Despite being an easy to learn programming language, there are some common pitfalls when switching over to Python from another programming language or starting from scratch with programming. Grace will be talking about the 10 most common mistakes that people make when developing with Python.

## [2014-08-18](2014-08-18) Using Setuptools and Anjunta IDE

Writing Python scripts is only the first step in developing a useful piece of software. Making the software available to other users via installers is a bit more challenging. In this meeting Peter Reutemann will discuss how to use setuptools for creating installers and virtualenv for testing them.

Furthermore, Ian Stewart will discuss the Anjuta IDE, which uses the Gnome libraries (Glib, GObject, GTK+, GBuilder, ...) and has built-in support for Glade as well.

## [2014-09-08](2014-09-08) Python scripts on Android and Blender

Chris Beckham will show how to run Python scripts on an Android phone.
Lawrence D'Oliveiro will demonstrate how to script the 3D animation software Blender using Python.

## [2014-10-13](2014-10-13) Gooey ~ Convert Command line to GUI and Wifi Webcams

Chris Beckham: Gooey (https://github.com/chriskiehl/Gooey) is a fairly recent project written in Python that allows one to convert easily console applications to GUI ones with just one extra line of code. This gives command-line loving developers (i.e. Unix philosophers) a way to cater their programs to those that are more comfortable with GUIs without having to do a bunch more work.

Peter Reutemann: DIY home monitoring with Wifi webcam(s) and a few lines of Python code.

## [2014-11-10](2014-11-10) Social Gathering

No fixed agenda for this meeting, just a social gathering. We'll chat about all things Python and may have some adhoc presentations.

## [2013-12-08](2013-12-08) Data Mining, Tkinter and PyQt5

• Peter Reutemann (http://www.cms.waikato.ac.nz/~fracpete/): let's do some data mining (https://github.com/fracpete/python-weka-wrapper)!

• Ian Stewart: The use of python list[]'s to manipulate widgets in a Tkinter and a PyQt5 GUI environment.

## [2014-02-09](2014-02-09) Automated Tests

Testing, testing, testing. Peter Reutemann (http://www.cms.waikato.ac.nz/~fracpete/) will give a short intro to automated tests in Python and what frameworks can be used.
