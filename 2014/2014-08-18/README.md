## Virtualenv and Setuptool

Peter Reutemann presented  virtualenv and using the setuptool python module.

The file *virtualenv_and_setuptools.odp* is Peter's slide show. While *PyFunk.tar.gz* 
is a zip of the files involved his **setuptools** presentation.


### Update Note as of 2019:

venv — Creation of virtual environments became new in version 3.3 (September 2012). 
The venv module provides support for creating lightweight “virtual environments” with their own 
site directories, optionally isolated from system site directories. 

The pyvenv script has been deprecated as of Python 3.6 (December 2016) in favor of using 
`python3 -m venv` to help prevent any potential confusion as to which Python interpreter 
a virtual environment will be based on. 

Deprecated since version 3.6: pyvenv was the recommended tool for creating virtual 
environments for Python 3.3 and 3.4, and is deprecated in Python 3.6.
