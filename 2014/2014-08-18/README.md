### Virtualenv and Setuptool
### M#7

Peter Reutemann presented  virtualenv and using the setuptool python module

#### Update Note. 2019

venv — Creation of virtual environments became new in version 3.3. The venv module 
provides support for creating lightweight “virtual environments” with their own 
site directories, optionally isolated from system site directories. 

#### Additional Note:

The pyvenv script has been deprecated as of Python 3.6 in favor of using `python3 -m venv` 
to help prevent any potential confusion as to which Python interpreter a virtual 
environment will be based on. 

Deprecated since version 3.6: pyvenv was the recommended tool for creating virtual 
environments for Python 3.3 and 3.4, and is deprecated in Python 3.6.
