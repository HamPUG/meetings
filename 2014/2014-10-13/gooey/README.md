Gooey
===

To get started with Gooey, run this command:

```
git clone https://github.com/chriskiehl/Gooey.git
```

(Alternatively, go [here](https://github.com/chriskiehl/Gooey) and download the .zip file for it.)

Then `cd` into the resulting directory and run `python setup.py install`. Now, it might install correctly, but when you go to use it in a project it may not work as you also need `wxPython`, which you can download [here](http://www.wxpython.org/).

As I said in the talk, I did manage to get `wxPython` installed on Linux, but Gooey would actually crash, so I'm not sure if I installed it correctly. However, it worked on Windows for me just fine.

** I will update this readme file if I manage to get it working. **

Examples

I have included in this folder the really basic "random number generator" example, called `gooey-rand`. For my image scraper, it's [here](https://github.com/chrispy645/gooey-imgur).
