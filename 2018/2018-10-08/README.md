### web-scraping

Lawrence Dâ€™Oliveiro demonstrated a simple web-scraping task, namely automating the downloading of files from a 3D model archive site, using Python with the BeautifulSoup HTML-analysis library. This could be a useful introduction to those new to the concept of web-scraping.

### Intel basic speed comparisons

Intel claims that their custom Python distribution (https://software.seek.intel.com/python-distribution) delivers "close-to-native-code performance". Peter Reutemann ran some basic speed comparisons to see whether it lives up to that claim.

### Introduce data manipulation using List methods

The list() function to convert a string to an array of characters is complemented by a string's join() method. The list methods include append() and pop(0) which allow a list to be used as a fifo buffer. Ian Stewart gave a brief Jupyter Notebook presentation to introduce data manipulation using list methods.
