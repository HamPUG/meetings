# 2018 Meetings

## [2018-02-12](2018-02-12) Deploy to PyPI, Deploy with mkdocs to Github. Python Learning Experience and QtCharts

Having your Python projects on github.com is a good start, but a lot of people are not familiar with using git or don't want to install code/generate documentation from source.
Peter Reutemann will show how to set up an installer for a Python library and how to deploy it to pypi.org, the central repository for Python libraries, making it available to everyone via "pip install". He will also demonstrate how you can use mkdocs (http://www.mkdocs.org/) to deploy beautiful documentation for your Python library straight to github.

Joseph Karl is a self-taught programmer, who learnt as a child, but didn't really carry it through seriously past my teens. He now has a desire to return to studying Computer Science or similar, and decided to have a go at programming again. After a bit of thought as to which language to use, he chose Python, and has set about learning to use it. For his attempt at Python, he took a text-based Star Trek game which he had started coding as a child, and this time successfully(ish) made it work in Python.
He will give a short presentation on his trials and travails in the art of learning to code again.

Time permitting, Ian has a prototype of his python PyQt application designed to aid in the learning of how to write python code that generates Qt-Charts. He'd like to demonstrate the way that it works and get feedback on how it could be improved.

## [2018-03-12](2018-03-12) Introduction into Python, Python on Windows and Qt-Charts

Lawrence D'Oliveiro will give an introduction into Python, suited for beginners and very good refresher for intermediate users.

Ian Stewart will talk you through installing Python on Windows 64bit for user interface development.
Time permitting, Ian will provide an update on the progress of his python PyQt application designed to aid in the learning of how to write python code that generates Qt-Charts.

## [2018-04-09](2018-04-09) Introduction to Python Classes and Virtual Environents

Lawrence D’Oliveiro will give an introduction to Python classes and the more esoteric aspects like descriptors and metaclasses.

Peter Reutemann will show you how to use virtual environments, plain and with Anaconda.

## [2018-05-14](2018-05-14) Jupyter Notebook

Let's have a Jupyter Notebook (https://jupyter.org/) install fest. So bring your laptop to the meetup, we'll set you up and show you the basics!

## [2018-06-11](2018-06-11) Introduction to a Microservice written in Python

Andreas Löf will give a gentle introduction to a microservice written in Python using the Flask framework. He will also show how to dockerise the microservice for testing in a production-like environment. Finally, Andreas will demonstrate the steps needed to deploy the microservice on Heroku as a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS).

## [2018-07-09](2018-07-09) Python Pandas

Gary Buczma will demo Python Pandas to unlock and exploit the potential of unstructured data and open data, as a Data science tool.

## [2018-08-13](2018-08-13) Introduction to Ctypes

Creating Custom API Bindings Using ctypes - Lawrence D'Oliveiro will give an introduction to ctypes, and how to use it to create bindings for non-Python APIs using pure Python. And also why doing so is actually a good idea.

## [2018-09-10](2018-09-10) Django served by WSGI server Waitress

Peter Reutemann will show how to serve a Django application (https://www.djangoproject.com/) through the pure-Python WSGI server waitress (https://github.com/Pylons/waitress).
waitress is an interesting and light-weight alternative to other WSGI capable servers like Apache/mod_wsgi, especially if you are only serving a single Python application.

## [2018-10-08](2018-10-08) Web-Scraping, Python Performance and Manipulating Lists

Lawrence D’Oliveiro will demonstrate a simple web-scraping task, namely automating the downloading of files from a 3D model archive site, using Python with the BeautifulSoup HTML-analysis library. This could be a useful introduction to those new to the concept of web-scraping.

Intel claims that their custom Python distribution (https://software.seek.intel.com/python-distribution) delivers "close-to-native-code performance". Peter Reutemann will run some basic speed comparisons to see whether it lives up to that claim.

The list() function to convert a string to an array of characters is complemented by a string's join() method. The list methods include append() and pop(0) which allow a list to be used as a fifo buffer. Time permitting, Ian Stewart will give a brief Jupyter Notebook presentation to introduce data manipulation using list methods.

## [2018-11-12](2018-11-12) Hacking EV's - CAN bus

Hacking EVs for dummies. Niall and Mark have been trying to take control of a Nissan Leaf's Battery Computer so that they can use it in other applications. They have had to learn a little CAN bus (Controller Area Network), a little Python and a little Raspberry Pi. They explain their progress so far and also where they hope to go with the project.

## [2018-12-10](2018-12-10) Gathering - No Topic

Have you come across a cool library or are you working on a project that you are passionate about? Would you like to give a short demo and/or presentation? Then please contact Peter the organizer.
