### Setting up Python on Windows x64

The Microsoft Windows Operating System currently ships without Python installed. 
This presentation provides a step-by-step guide to installing Python onto a 
Windows 7 (64-bit) platform. This guide should also be applicable for other 
versions of Windows.

#### The installation of Python provides: 

1. A terminal session window for running an interactive session of python.
2. The IDLE Integrated Development Environment for Python.
3. Python off-line reference manuals.
4. A web-based Python module documentation reader.

The above is all that is needed to commence writing Python programs. Should 
you wish to enhance the environment in which you do your Python 
development, then the remainder of the presentation provides these options:

1. Installing Notepad++ as your Python script editor.
2. Installing Jupyter Notebook to run and test snippets of code you develop.
3. Installing PyInstaller so you may distribute and executable version of your 
code to a Windows User that has not installed Python.

The presentation is comprised mostly of screen shots from performing these 
installations. The intention of this presentation that you have it open on your 
desktop when doing the installations and use it as a cross-reference.

The presentation is available as a powerpoint or pdf file:
* Setting up Python on Windows x64.pptx (6MB)
* Setting up Python on Windows x64.pdf (5.5MB)
