## [2023-02-13](2023-02-13) ChatGPT writing Python programs

Let's jump on the ChatGPT hype train and test whether we can use it as a tool for writing Python programs. Ian Stewart will not only recount his experiences so far, but also perform a live demo (attendees are welcome to provide their Python query to ChatGPT and then we will review the Python code that is produced).


## [2023-03-13](2023-03-13) Gradio and Textual user interfaces

Over the years, we have explored how we can build user interfaces using tkinter, GTK, PyQt, kivy and Jupyter Notebooks. However, there are other, not so well known ways that have appeal.
This time, Peter Reutemann will demo how you can use gradio (which is aimed at machine learning models; browser-based) and textual (user interfaces for the console) to quickly build some simple interfaces.


## [2023-04-12](2023-04-12) Aspects of Python

Stuck with your Python project and you would like to get a fresh perspective? Got a little project that you would like to demo for a few minutes? Then come along to this "social gathering" and catch up with other Pythonistas like Ian Stewart.
Due to the University being closed on the Easter Monday and Tuesday, the meeting will be held on Wednesday 12 April.

## [2023-05-08](2023-05-08) Datasette

Whilst there are plenty of Python libraries around for exploring data, like Pandas, there is a lot to learn before exploration, visualization and publication of results are sorted. Especially for non-data scientists.

Enter Datasette, which according to their website: helps people take data of any shape, analyze and explore it, and publish it as an interactive website and accompanying API and is aimed at data journalists, museum curators, archivists, local governments, scientists, researchers and anyone else who has data that they wish to share with the world.

Peter Reutemann will take the tool for a spin and see what you can do with it.

## [2023-05-10](2023-07-10) pygubu-designer

tkinter is the standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit and the de-facto standard for Python user interfaces. However, developing interfaces by hand is slow and error-prone. Peter Reutemann will demo the pygubu designer, which makes creating tkinter interfaces not only faster, but also easier to create good looking ones.
