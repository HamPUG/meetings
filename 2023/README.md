## [2023-02-13](2023-02-13) ChatGPT writing Python programs

Let's jump on the ChatGPT hype train and test whether we can use it as a tool for writing Python programs. Ian Stewart will not only recount his experiences so far, but also perform a live demo (attendees are welcome to provide their Python query to ChatGPT and then we will review the Python code that is produced).


## [2023-03-13](2023-03-13) Gradio and Textual user interfaces

Over the years, we have explored how we can build user interfaces using tkinter, GTK, PyQt, kivy and Jupyter Notebooks. However, there are other, not so well known ways that have appeal.
This time, Peter Reutemann will demo how you can use gradio (which is aimed at machine learning models; browser-based) and textual (user interfaces for the console) to quickly build some simple interfaces.
