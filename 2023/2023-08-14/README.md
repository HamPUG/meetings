**David Clarke** was involved in the development of the system underpinning the
recent census. He will provide a high-level view of how the responses are
turned into useable data. Due to the sensitive nature of the project, there
will be no actual census data or source code from the system available or
viewable at any point. However, there are still plenty of options for
discussing the tools and techniques used for deriving the output data from the
input responses.
