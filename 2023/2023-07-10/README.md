[tkinter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tkinter) is the standard Python interface to the [Tk GUI toolkit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tk_(software)) and the de-facto standard for Python user interfaces. However, developing interfaces by hand is slow and error-prone. Peter Reutemann will demo the [pygubu designer](https://github.com/alejandroautalan/pygubu-designer), which makes creating tkinter interfaces not only faster, but also easier to create good looking ones.

Large number of example UIs available:
