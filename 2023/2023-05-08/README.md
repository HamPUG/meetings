Whilst there are plenty of Python libraries around for exploring data, like Pandas, there is a lot to learn before exploration, visualization and publication of results are sorted. Especially for non-data scientists.

Enter Datasette, which according to their website: helps people take data of any shape, analyze and explore it, and publish it as an interactive website and accompanying API and is aimed at data journalists, museum curators, archivists, local governments, scientists, researchers and anyone else who has data that they wish to share with the world.

Peter Reutemann will take the tool for a spin and see what you can do with it.
