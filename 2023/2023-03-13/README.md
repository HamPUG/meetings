Over the years, we have explored how we can build user interfaces using tkinter, GTK, PyQt, kivy and Jupyter Notebooks. However, there are other, not so well known ways that have appeal.
This time, Peter Reutemann will demo how you can use [gradio](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio) (which is aimed at machine learning models; browser-based) and [textual](https://github.com/Textualize/textual) (user interfaces for the console) to quickly build some simple interfaces.
