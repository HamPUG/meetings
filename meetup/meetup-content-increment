Wordle and R's Wordcloud

Details

Using Python to scrape all the song lyrics from a particular artist (from lyricsfreak.com) and then create a word cloud from all those lyrics using either using Wordle or using R's wordcloud package. The idea was to get a visual representation of the words that were said the most by a particular band or artist.

Editors and IDE's

Details

We continue with our journey on exploring editors and IDEs that can be used for Python development: Ninja IDE, Spyderlib, Cat, Komodo, Textmate, Sublime, Eric.
Furthermore, Grace will be talking about the most common mistakes that people make when developing with Python.

Note: First month of using Meetup.com

Comments

Peter R.~

Probably due to the meetup.com group change, some previous attendees didn't come along to this meeting. However, it was still as interesting evening, despite some improvisation regarding presentations.

Christopher B.~

Argggh, apologies for not making it, I completely forgot. (Recently, I did look at meetup.com to find when the next meeting was happening and didn't see anything. I think it was due to the group change as you said Peter.)

I can always do it next presentation, but if you're sick of IDE presentations and/or I don't have a time slot to present in, I can put my IDE "first impressions" on Github, which I believe is a nice summary of things.

Peter R.~

We had a quick round up of SpyderLib and Sublime, so I think we're good with IDEs/editors for now. Please commit your "first impressions" to github!

Chris O.~

I should belately put in my apologies. My wife was sick yesterday so I was looking after our little one. I had hoped to still make the meeting but by 7pm it was apparent I was still needed at home.
I was keen to see the Sublime presentation.

Peter R.~

Family comes first! My knowledge of Sublime was limited to installing and playing with it for 5min. However, Garion uses it as his main tool for developing in PHP. Looked pretty good!

Common Mistakes

Details

Despite being an easy to learn programming language, there are some common pitfalls when switching over to Python from another programming language or starting from scratch with programming. Grace will be talking about the 10 most common mistakes that people make when developing with Python.

Comments

Eric L.~

Really enjoyed hanging around and chatting after this one. Good run-down of some tricky bits by Grace, and a good pre-talk talk by Lawrence

Using Setuptools and Anjunta IDE

Details

Writing Python scripts is only the first step in developing a useful piece of software. Making the software available to other users via installers is a bit more challenging. In this meeting Peter Reutemann will discuss how to use setuptools for creating installers and virtualenv for testing them.

Furthermore, Ian Stewart will discuss the Anjuta IDE, which uses the Gnome libraries (Glib, GObject, GTK+, GBuilder, ...) and has built-in support for Glade as well.

Comments

Peter R.~

Lively discussion as usual. :-)

Chris O.~

Great. Thanks to both Peter and Ian for well prepared talks.

Chris O.~

After the meeting I manage to compile PyQt4 and numpy into a virtual environment using python3.2 IIRC. I probably should have stopped when it needed sudo permissions since it's now put some files (overwritten, gulp) into /usr/share. Hopefully it hasn't broken anything.

Python scripts on Android and Blender

Details

Chris Beckham will show how to run Python scripts on an Android phone.
Lawrence D'Oliveiro will demonstrate how to script the 3D animation software Blender using Python.

Comments

Eric L.~

Damn going to miss this one as well....getting ready for Kiwi PyCon! Have fun everyone :)

Peter R.~

In that case you'll have to wear a T-shirt at Kiwi PyCon advertising Python meetups in Hamilton. :-)

Peter R.~

Cool demo on modifying a Blender scene from a Python shell. sl4a sounds like a nice way for prototyping on Android, without overheads of IDEs.

Gooey ~ Convert Command line to GUI and Wifi Webcams

Details

Chris Beckham: Gooey (https://github.com/chriskiehl/Gooey) is a fairly recent project written in Python that allows one to convert easily console applications to GUI ones with just one extra line of code. This gives command-line loving developers (i.e. Unix philosophers) a way to cater their programs to those that are more comfortable with GUIs without having to do a bunch more work.

Peter Reutemann: DIY home monitoring with Wifi webcam(s) and a few lines of Python code.

Comments

Chris O.~

Can I please put in my belated apologies for not attending last nights meeting. I was interested to read up about the project and would have been interested to see it demonstrated.

Peter R.~

No worries. I've put my stuff re monitoring on github (https://github.com/HamPUG/meetings/tree/master/2014-10-13). Hopefully, Chris will put some examples of the gooey tool up there as well.

Christopher B.~

Don't worry, I'll put some stuff on too. :)

2015-07-13

Tkinter

Details

Brian Hardyment will show you how to use tkinter (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tkinter) for developing graphical user interfaces in Python. Why tkinter? It is part of the Python installation on Windows and Mac, requiring no further libraries to be installed. Also, the latest iterations of tkinter provide native widgets, making your Python application look like an actual native application.

Comments

Saeid S.~

Hi everyone..

Recently I bumped into an interview question which looks very simple but it is not !!

here is the question :

Given a string of numbers in sequence order. find the missing number. Range is not given.
sample input:"9899100101103104105"
Answer:102

If you like challenges try it !! keep in mind that you are not supposed to spend too much time on it..

Regards,
Saeid.

Peter R.~

Live streaming to YouTube didn't work, unfortunately. But it was a helpful session to decide (for myself) that tkinter is definitely not the way to go for developing user interfaces in Python.

We need volunteers to make this work!

Comments

William M.~

super cool that you are coming down from akl fot this Jeremy!

Jeremy S.~

Had to return the favour :)

Peter R.~

Great demos of various command-line parsing frameworks! Was really amazed at simplicity of "begins" - definitely my choice for small projects. Also, "docopt" uses the definitions taken from doc strings to generate a parser, which I will consider for some larger projects.

Yindong X.~

it's cool, make things simple.

William M.~

Great meetup. This is definitely something I need to add to my programs. Special thanks to Jeremy/Aaron for making the trip down from Auckland. The led badge was awesome.

Nikola, Pelican, Communication with USB devices

Details

Currently lined up:

• William Mckee will demo Nikola (https://getnikola.com/), a Static Site Generator

• Peter Reutemann will give a short intro to the Pelican (http://blog.getpelican.com/) Static Site Generator

• Ian Stewart - Using Python to communicate with USB devices or What I do NOT know about USB devices!

If you'd like to give a short demo or talk about a Python-related topic (eg site generator, command-line parser are current topics), then please contact the organizer (Peter).

Comments

William M.~

Created slides for the talk. Will wing it for the demo. Demoed before a Hamilton Computer Club so should be sweet. Ready for your questions.

Might be neat if someone wants to talk about a different static blog or even a responsive blog/cms
Pelican is popular (and very pretty) that is Python based - Linux Kernal use it for their blog.

William M.~

Hi,
I've been having issues with my laptops so may need to borrow one for my talk.
My slides wont be a problem because all they need is a web browser.

I guess you will get to see a full, fresh install of Nikola!

Preference for a system running Debian Jessie.

Peter R.~

I'm running Mint 17.

William M.~

Sweet, that should be fine. I can do a python3 virtualenv. Other option is Ian.

Peter R.~

Back to basics, or how to generate websites using static site generators. William gave a nice introduction to Nikola and Peter about Pelican. Ian was delving deep (or at least started diving) into USB hardware using pyudev.

Chris O.~

low key but definitely interesting

Interactive Graphics using Ipython Notebook and Jupyter Notebook with Nikola

Details

Lawrence D'Oliveiro is demoing interactive graphics using IPython Notebook.

William McKee is demoing Jupyter Notebook/Jupyterhub and how it can be used with Nikola.

Discussion of March meeting, which will be run as an introduction to Python (eg Python basics, teaser on GUI and web development).

We have plenty of space for lightning talks! I you have come across a cool library or done something cool, hacky with Python, then this is your chance to give a short demo/presentation of what you have done (5min will do). Just contact the organizer Peter and let him know.

Comments

William M.~

IPython Notebook is deprecated and has been replaced by Jupyter.

Jupyter is far broader. I've been using both Jupyter Notebook and Jupyterhub (multi user notebooks).

I could maybe do a lightning talk on Jupyter and using it with Nikola (relevant from previous meeting).

Ian S.~

With regard to discussing the delivery of an "Introduction to Python" at future meetings, then at some point there is the issue of introducing a GUI. Tkinter/ttk appears to be the de-facto GUI to get started on. I'm in the process of writing some python3 programs that introduce all the ttk widgets. Perhaps these programs could be turned into a tutorial and demonstrated. You can try out the programs I've written so far at...

https://github.com/irsbugs/ttk_demos/tree/master

All the GUI programs have the a similar layout. This should help with negotiating the GUI learning curve.

cheers, Ian.

micah w.~

Just throwing it out there.. and ive been wrestling with this over time so Im a sympathiser (happy to be shot down)... my q is whats the relevance of windows gui dev these days when we have browser based 2 way binding thru client side web mvc incl websockets etc and more control over look n feel.. Howsabout say a flask app fired up locally and using an mvc like angular 2 ( heard 2 is v v fast ) and render everything in the browser? My Windows UI world became a happier place when WPF and MVVM kicked off, but now the same is available in a browser context? Thoughts?

William M.~

My glasses are completely broken now so I will see how I go - rather blind. If anyone else can talk instead of me might be good. Sorry, see how i get on.

Peter R.~

No worries

Nikola, Raspberry Pi and Introduction to Python

Details

Our March meeting is aimed at people new to Python and ones that would like to find out more about the language.

We will kick off the evening by demonstrating Python tools and applications:

• William McKee will demonstrate Nikola (https://getnikola.com/), a static site generator written in Python, for generating great looking, mobile-friendly websites.

• Ian Stewart and his Raspberry Pi (https://www.raspberrypi.org/) will show off Python's hardware side of things, bringing LEDs to light.

After the demonstrations, Lawrence D'Oliveiro will give an introduction into Python, showing off its succinct but easy to read syntax, using IPython Notebook (http://ipython.org/notebook.html).

The evening will conclude with a ability to mingle, ask more questions and get first-hand advice from Pythonistas (https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Pythonista).

Comments

William M.~

I will also bring the newly released Raspberry Pi 3, official 7 inch touch screen,

I saw this. Well done William and Peter.

Ian S.~

Hi Everyone. Please note that, as of this morning, Waikato University Gate 7 on Hillcrest Road is still closed due to construction work. For those driving to the Python meetup tonight please use Gate 10 off Silverdale Rd. Drive up through all the car parks to park next to building MS4.

Chris O.~

I know I mentioned it a few times last night, but if you're interested in getting python working on Windows system then you can use the Anaconda distribution from continuum.

https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install

https://www.continuum.io/downloads

If you new to Python, start with Python3.5. Pretty much all the active third party libraries have migrated now.

With Ananconda installed, you'll even get a GUI menu option to start your ipython3 notebook and away you go!.

Anaconda has done all the hard work of compiling a large variety of third party libraries - which is one of the huge attractions of Python.

Excellent variety of talks guys.

Raul C.~

to the organizers, thanks a lot for setting this up and most especially for selflessly sharing your knowledge, time and food with everyone. great to have met quite a number of pythonistas.

Ian S.~

The files used for the Monday 14 March 2016 presentations have been posted on the Hamilton Python User Group github site. Look in the subdirectories of...

https://github.com/HamPUG/meetings/tree/master/2016/2016-03-14

The overall presentation is an open document presentation (.odp) file. LibreOffice and OpenOffice Impress will open it, as well as newer versions of MS Office Powerpoint.

The Python Intro Talk.ipynb requires the IPython/Jupyter notebook application to be installed to excute the cells of the example python code.

Jason E.~

Will there be any new meet ups aimed at new python users coming up? I am new to the language and programming, should i come along anyway?

Peter R.~

Sorry for late reply. We will have another introduction to Python session at start of uni b semester. Will get advertised closer to the time. Cheers, Peter

Meeting Secondary School NCEA specification

Details

Review some of the units of the Secondary School NCEA computing and digital technologies. For those that want to give it a try, the challenge for the next month will be to write a Python program that meets the specification and present their program at the May meeting

Comments

William M.~

I've taken a look at some of the units and have rewritten some of the assessment examples to make them suck less.

Using sample instead of randint, and using getpass instead of inputting user, plus cleaning up repetitive code. Imports randomly throughout the examples instead of at the top (even in the excellence!)

Can present some of the example assessments, my thoughts and the changes.

Also integrated giphy api for lawls.

William M.~

Sorry, can't make it. Have the flu. The script I was working on - https://github.com/wcmckee/wcmckee/blob/master/numbernerd.ipynb. Will work on it further and talk about it at May meeting.

Telsa Model S JSON API. Flask. Meetup.com accessed from web2py website. Teaching Python

Details

William Mckee is talking about the Tesla Model S JSON API (http://docs.timdorr.apiary.io/) and the Vehicle Information Access API (https://www.w3.org/TR/vehicle-information-api/) - configuring and extending with Python.

William will also talk about the Python micro-framework Flask (http://flask.pocoo.org/) for building websites and apps. He will cover the history, basics and extensions such as flask_restful/Flask-Security/flask-jsonify. Demo of how easy it is to get started. How to use it to build and serve a RESTful API. With Flask you can build up rather than start heavy and bloated with frameworks such as Django (https://www.djangoproject.com/).

Together with Ian Stewart we will attempt on accessing the Meetup.com API (https://www.meetup.com/meetup_api/) in a web2py (http://www.web2py.com/) test environment for displaying the next upcoming meeting.

Also, Ian Stewart has been creating a template methodology as an approach for teaching Python to secondary school students. Ian will display and demonstrate his template code, and welcomes all feedback on this methodology and how to improve the code in his templates.

Comments

William M.~

Really looking forward to Ians talk on Meetup API. It's something I have wanted to look at myself - especially for creating meetups and checking if it's a public holiday and embedding them into apps

After discussion with Ian about floating-point behaviour, I have written a module https://github.com/ldo/pyfenv to give control to IEEE-754 exceptions and rounding from Python. I can talk a little about this, if anybody is interested.

Peter R.~

Already lined up quite a bit. Maybe we can push that into December? I'm interested in that topic!

Ian S.~

Lawrence, Thanks for further investigation of python's floating point. One program I'll present is an introduction to floating point.

Great interactive talks. Loved William's presentations on Tesla and Flask. Robust discussion on Ian's example/template code for secondary teachers.

Ian S.~

Congratulations to Peter on his robust code enhancements to the
https://hampug.pythonanywhere.com/ web-site. I see that today its picked up 12 December as the date for the next Python meeting. I'd like to thank everyone for their feedback which I'll incorporate into the presentation I'll be doing for teachers. ...and sorry I went on so long and made for a rather late evening.

Peter R.~

Thanks for that, Ian. I enhanced it a bit more, also displaying the description of the next meeting. However, I haven't found a way to output raw HTML...

William M.~

Thanks for the talk Ian. Might create something that displays the next meetup in a markdown file. Would create a script that gets the information and writes to file, then builds the site.

Chris O.~

Good to see lots of discussion about how to teach programming to high school kids

IEEE=754 Exceptions and Rounding. Escape sequences of Windows10 CMD. IPython Notebook on pythonanywhere.com

Details

Lawrence D'Oliveiro has written a module https://github.com/ldo/pyfenv to give control to IEEE-754 exceptions and rounding from Python, which he will introduce.

Do you remember in the 80s how we had video terminals that used escape sequences to draw rectangles, change colors, and enhance text with underline and reverse video etc.? In May 2016 Microsoft enabled support for this on their Windows 10 CMD and Powershell console windows. Ian Stewart (or Peter Reutemann) will demonstrate some Python code highlighting these escape sequences.

Harry, our support specialist at pythonanywhere.com, has granted our account at https://hampug.pythonanywhere.com/ the temporary ability to use IPython Notebook. We will give a demo of using IPython Notebook on pythonanywhere.com.

William M.~

There were lots at last months meeting. would be great to hear from them and how they use python. Saw Jeremy at kiwicon and said hes interested in coming down to hamilton again for a meeting - would be great to get him to do a talk (his talks are always favs of mine at kiwipycon/kiwicon).

William M.~

Have a 50th of family friend to attend this weekend and likely won't be back in Hamilton for this meetup.

The website seems down. Getting a Error code: 502-backend.

Peter R.~

Enjoy the celebration and we'll see you in the new year!

Ian S.~

Sorted out the error on https://hampug.pythonanywhere.com/ web-site. Should be OK now.

William M.~

Good news - going to be able make it to the meetup now - was a quick trip down south.

William M.~

also any chance someone can bring along a wlug membership form? I will have 20 dollars for it.

Peter R.~

Can print one and bring it along.

Ian S.~

Sorry, but I'm expecting to be a bit late - depends on AKL traffic! I've logged the website error with their support team.

Nathan H.~

Hey all, great Python meetup on Monday 12 December! Lawrence might have actually made floating point math fun for a change. For me, it was quite fascinating. Question: Do we own this forum? https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/nzpug Wonder if we have rights to clean it up. I noticed some pretty unnecessary, defamatory ranting going on in there.

Peter R.~

That's the forum of the overarching NZ Python User Group Society, which is open to any Python user (aimed at NZ users). If you come across posts that go against their code of conduct, make the moderator aware of it.

Peter R.~

Great talk by Lawrence on IEEE 754 in relation to Python. Probably the most entertaining and engaging IEEE talk that I've been to. Loved Ian's presentation on ANSI escape sequences in the Windows command prompt - should be a good exercise for High School students that want to make their command-line applications look nicer.

Let's start the New Year with a social get together and meet at The Cook in Hamilton East. There we can talk about all things Python and the cool things that we got up to over the Xmas break!

Comments

Edward W.~

The cook has a quiz night on mondays @ 7:30pm so all the tables get reserved by quiz teams.

William M.~

not upstairs. When we did this in the past we have been upstairs.

Owen M.~

Look forward to meeting you. New to Python so go easy on me!

Peter R.~

Don't worry, we are a very mixed group in terms of Python skill levels.

Owen M.~

Great to meet you all this evening, and thanks for the crash course. A very eclectic bunch, and we probably would have aced the quiz downstairs.

Peter R.~

Great to see so many new faces. Looking forward to the next meeting.

William M.~

im especially interested on the talk on gpus.

Owen M.~

Sorry I can't make it as my wife is undergoing chemo at the moment. Hopefully will be back in 3 months or so.

Peter R.~

Not a problem. Hopefully your wife will get well soon.

William M.~

Great meetup as usual - shame about so many no shows. Disappointing. Lawrence certainly gave good tips that I can use - especially with looping. Always good to hear about my 2nd fav web framework - Flask (I bet you can guess my number 1), Chris talk on python and gpus is something I know nothing about about so lots of learning. Cheers!

Chris O.~

Thanks to the other presenters. Learnt a few tips from Lawrence's talk.

William Mckee's talk has been moved to the July meetup (https://www.meetup.com/NZPUG-Hamilton/events/236200062/).

Comments

Lawrence D.~

I could talk a bit about coroutines and asyncio in Python 3.5, if anyone’s interested.

Peter R.~

I'd be interested :-)

Lawrence D.~

I figure I could talk for about half an hour.

Lawrence D.~

Can I assume that people know about generator functions? Otherwise it’ll end up being a longer talk. ;)

William M.~

Hi, I have got a ticket to blockchainnz conf so unable to make it. Sorry. Can do this talk another month. seems like Lawrence and Ian can make up for my change.

Peter R.~

Shame. I'll move you to next month then.

Peter R.~

Best to include the generator functions :-)

Lawrence D.~

OK, it shall be a longer talk: generators, coroutines, asyncio.

Syyed H.~

Hi, I am yet to start learning Python development but I am really interested. Would this session help me or should I join in later meetings after doing some catching up ? If Catching up is required, can you please guide me on what sources do I need to go through for it ?

Thanks

Lawrence D.~

I intend to start gently, but I will go deep.

Lawrence D.~

Do you know what a coroutine is? It’s like a thread, only simpler.

Chris O.~

Sorry. Please accept my apologies for tonight's talk. Looks good.

Peter R.~

Lawrence's is probably a bit more advanced, but Ian's should be easy to follow, even for beginner. We try putting the material on our GitHub account: GitHub.com/hampug/meetings - see the last two meetings where Lawrence gave an excellent intro to Python.

Peter R.~

Sorry, but something has cropped up on short notice and I won't be able to attend tonight after all. Enjoy the great line up!

Introduction to Python classes. Processing CSV files and API calls.

Details

Lawrence D'Oliveiro will give an introduction into Python classes and the more esoteric aspects like meta-classes.

Nathan Humphrey will show how you can use Python to process CSV files from the command-line.

As a follow-on to the presentation William delivered last month on using API's to access data at the Zalando web-site, Ian Stewart will present the three API calls (http://docs.energyhiveapi.apiary.io/) that retrieve data from the energyhive (https://www.energyhive.com/) web-site.

Comments

Peter R.~

Shall hold an intro to Python again?

Peter R.~

Despite the overtime, great meetup. Nice presentation by Nathan how to automate tedious work tasks with Python. Diving deep into classes, decorators and meta-classes with Lawrence. Nice application of using web APIs to retrieve energy readings for the visually impaired by Ian.

William M.~

Great meetup. Lots of content. I found Peters comment regarding payload/params in Requests especially helpful. Used it today in a script, and will replace my other code. Enjoyed Nathans talk. I have feature requests for Nathans uni room request. GIFs and memes, analyze the text and respond appropriately :P

Ian S.~

Nathan. Many thanks for your presentation and good to see your programs working OK.

I noticed that your code is comprised of sequential statements. This works fine, but as you add more functionality to the program, then it will become difficult to maintain. A solution to this is to write code in a "procedural" programming style.

I have written 4 x example programs. The first program is a set of sequential statements. The next 3 x examples, show this code being rearranged so that it becomes a procedural program. These programs are at...

https://github.com/HamPUG/examples/tree/master/procedural_programming

Please take a look at these examples and try converting your code. Alternatively if you'd like to send me your code examples, then I'll do the conversions.

I've also posted seven programs showing the incremental steps in writing a python GUI program using Gtk+. You might be able to use these as template programs for porting your code to be a GUI application.

cheers,
Ian.

Asyncio/Conway's Game of Life and Client/Server via the sysyem D-Bus

Details

asyncio (https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html) - Asynchronous I/O, event loop, coroutines and tasks in Python 3.5.

Lawrence D'Oliveiro will give an intro to his wrapper for the GLib event loop and also explain the asyncio API a bit.

Ian Stewart will first talk about how Cycle Analyst (http://www.ebikes.ca/product-info/cycle-analyst-3.html) is used to monitor and control an electric bike. It also broadcasts the status of the bike every second as a ttl async ascii record of 14 tab delimited fields.

After that, Ian will present how to use USB to ttl serial converter cable (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_adapter) to create the device ttyUSB0. He will demonstrate a Python 3.5 server program using asyncio to capture the data. The server emits this data over the system D-Bus. A client app subscribes to the D-Bus to capture and process the data. The clients processed data is broadcast as a console and an audio message.

Comments

Peter R.~

Great demonstration of what you can do with light-weight coroutines. Hadn't seen Conway's Game of Life in years! ;-) Cool hardware demo by Ian.

It is the end of semester and university is busy with exams again. Let's just head down to the pub and discuss all things Python over a drink. This is a great opportunity to meet other Pythonistas or, if you are thinking about diving into Python, to get first hand information about using the programming language.

Comments

Peter R.~

The Cook is currently getting renovated, hence the switch to The Homestead. I reserved for 10 people in the bar stool table area for "Python User Group". At least this time they seem to have understood the name. Not "Pipe Music group" like last time. ;-)

William M.~

I'm going to be back in New Zealand for KiwiPyCon in Auckland on 2/3rd December. I'll be speaking about Nikola. Hope to see some of you there. I'm also speaking this week at SyDjango on Nikola (been awhile since I've talked about it so good warmup).

Deploy to PyPI, Deploy with mkdocs to Github. Python Learning Experience and QtCharts

Details

Having your Python projects on github.com is a good start, but a lot of people are not familiar with using git or don't want to install code/generate documentation from source.
Peter Reutemann will show how to set up an installer for a Python library and how to deploy it to pypi.org, the central repository for Python libraries, making it available to everyone via "pip install". He will also demonstrate how you can use mkdocs (http://www.mkdocs.org/) to deploy beautiful documentation for your Python library straight to github.

Joseph Karl is a self-taught programmer, who learnt as a child, but didn't really carry it through seriously past my teens. He now has a desire to return to studying Computer Science or similar, and decided to have a go at programming again. After a bit of thought as to which language to use, he chose Python, and has set about learning to use it. For his attempt at Python, he took a text-based Star Trek game which he had started coding as a child, and this time successfully(ish) made it work in Python.
He will give a short presentation on his trials and travails in the art of learning to code again.

Time permitting, Ian has a prototype of his python PyQt application designed to aid in the learning of how to write python code that generates Qt-Charts. He'd like to demonstrate the way that it works and get feedback on how it could be improved.

Comments

Peter R.~

Not to late, just send me a short blurb and I'll add it.

Peter R.~

Just added your blurb. Thanks, Joseph.

Peter R.~

Just a reminder, we're meeting in TX3.G.01 tonight, not the usual spot:

I've uploaded my presentation from last night to our github account: https://github.com/HamPUG/meetings/tree/master/2018/2018-02-12

Peter R.~

Update the presentation in terms of uploading project to pypi: you need twine>=1.8.0 installed

Ian S.~

Thanks for everyone’s feedback on my QtChart prototype program. I’ve cleaned up my resource collection of images and stored them in the main program but not in the exported example programs. I also found a way to make the splitter handles have an image and some colour. The python/css-ish code is…

    self.splitter.setStyleSheet(""",
    QSplitter::handle {
    background-color: skyblue;
    image: url(:/images/horizontal_splitter.svg);
    height: 12px;

    }
    QSplitter::handle:pressed {
    background-color: rgb(100, 200, 255);
    image: url(:/images/horizontal_splitter_pressed.svg);
    }""")

...I'll show you at next months meeting.

Web-Scraping, Python Performance and Manipulating Lists

Details

Lawrence D’Oliveiro will demonstrate a simple web-scraping task, namely automating the downloading of files from a 3D model archive site, using Python with the BeautifulSoup HTML-analysis library. This could be a useful introduction to those new to the concept of web-scraping.

Intel claims that their custom Python distribution (https://software.seek.intel.com/python-distribution) delivers "close-to-native-code performance". Peter Reutemann will run some basic speed comparisons to see whether it lives up to that claim.

The list() function to convert a string to an array of characters is complemented by a string's join() method. The list methods include append() and pop(0) which allow a list to be used as a fifo buffer. Time permitting, Ian Stewart will give a brief Jupyter Notebook presentation to introduce data manipulation using list methods.

Libraries/frameworks that can assist with ETL (extract, transform, load)

Details

Peter Reutemann will present some libraries/frameworks that can assist with ETL (extract, transform, load). ETL is a process for copying from one or more sources to a destination that represents the data differently, often used in Data Warehousing (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load).

I have to apologize regarding petl: the "addcolumn" method returns a copy of the table, rather than performing the operation in-place. Also fixed the data truncation issues by using sqlalchemy engines instead of native sqlite/mysql connections. Finally, I added timing output to show the performance of the frameworks (top-level README.md contains the overview of speeds).

Typing Hints and Different kernels for Jupyter Notebooks

Details

Peter Reutemann will briefly talk about Typing hints, introduced with Python 3.6, and also talk about different kernels for Jupyter Notebooks.

Comments

Peter R.~

I'm still looking for a presenter. Don't be shy, even a 5min presentation/demo can be very useful to attendees - and you will most likely get useful feedback. Or if you have a problem that you just can't solve, present it and we can attempt to solve it together!

Peter R.~

Somebody feel like talking about type hints (PEP 484)? https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/

Peter R.~

My Jupyter notebooks and instructions are now available online:
https://github.com/HamPUG/meetings/tree/master/2019/2019-07-08
NB: Python itself does not do anything with the type hints itself, you need a static checker like mypy (http://mypy-lang.org/) for this.

Laby the Ant and Manipulation of PulseAudio

Details

The Laby application (https://sgimenez.github.io/laby/) is designed to help you learn programming languages and this includes the Python language. The programs you write need to guide an ant through a labyrinth full of rocks and spider webs until the ant gets to the escape door. Ian Stewart will demonstrate some of the code that he has written in Python for his ant.

Peter Reutemann got annoyed at his laptop dock always reverting the audio settings on Linux, so he decided to see whether it was possible to manipulate pulseaudio from Python. The result: a bunch of command-line tools and a tray-icon application for managing profiles.

Comments

Number Theory and use of recursion

Details

Mathematics is often seen as a closed book by many people. However, with an easy to read programming language, like Python, it is possible to make mathematical fields such as number theory more approachable and even fun.
Computers provide recursion ...with no effort. In some cases a mathematical theory may be explored with a simple Python program that quickly covers all possibilities and their outcomes. A tedious task if it was to be done manually.

Ian Stewart will demo his take on Kaprekar's constant (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6174_(number)).

Lawrence D'Oliveiro will show you some fun things with continued fractions, such as approximating Pi.

Peter Reutemann will combine simple formulas with complex numbers to generate some fractals.

Please contact Peter if you'd like to demo/present other interesting or quirky, "mathematically" inspired Python code snippets. Maybe take a look at the "On-line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences" (http://oeis.org/)?

This time, Peter Reutemann will demo how you can use gradio (which is aimed at machine learning models; browser-based) and textual (user interfaces for the console) to quickly build some simple interfaces.
