What is this?
-------------

Little demonstration of how to use data mining on publicly available data.

The `python-weka-wrapper` library enables you to use the WEKA machine learning
workbench (written in Java) in a Python environment.

Public mailing list archives of the Waikato Linux Users Group:

http://list.waikato.ac.nz/pipermail/wlug/


What are the requirements?
--------------------------

* Linux machine
* Oracle JDK 1.6+
* build environment for C/C++ code
* pip python-weka-wrapper

Misc
----

The `list.flow` is a workflow file for the ADAMS system, which was used
to prototype the data mining task, before translating it to a Python script.
