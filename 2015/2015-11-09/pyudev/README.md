# Detecting Insertion and Removal of a USB device using pyudev.

An introduction to the effects of inserting and removing a USB device. Pyudev
module is used to monitor and callback on the insertion and removal of a USB
device. Pyudev monitoring is supported in the pyqt4, pyside, glib, and
wxWidgets GUI toolkits.

The four demo programs use the wxWidgets toolkit, but they may be easily
converted to use one of the other supported GUI toolkits.
