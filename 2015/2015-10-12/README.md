## Command Line Parsing Frameworks

Brief presentations were delivered on some of the command line parsing 
Python modules. 

**begin** - *Command line programs for busy developers*
**plac** - *The smartest command line arguments parser in the world*
**sys.argv** - *Most command line arguments parsers initially use*


Also, in the form of a quiz, there is a presentation is designed to 
highlight the number of lines of code involved in using sys.argv, argparse, and plac.

Refer to the sub-directories: *begins*, *plac*, *quiz*, and *sys.argv*.
