Python Version Minimum
======================

Presentation on 11 May 2015 at Hamilton Python User Group meeting.

This presentation is a challenge to write the most efficient code to politely
terminate the execution of the python interpreter if the python interpreter is
detected to be below the minimum required revision to run the python script.

It offers a comparison of efficiency between a *for* loop and *list comprehensions*. 

It also highlights why *beautiful is better than ugly* is the first line in the
Zen of Python!
