### Using Python as the macro script with Libreoffice.

Libre Office distribution includes the BASIC scripting language for use with
Libre Office applications. Ian Stewart presented the use of Python as an 
alternative scripting language for Libre Office.

Ian also provided code that converts an application that uses python script in 
the User library, to having the python script embedded in the Libre Office 
document file.

See the sub-directory *libreoffice* for Ian's presentation material.
