When a man lies, he murders some part of the world. These are the pale deaths which men miscall their lives. All this I cannot bear to witness any longer. Cannot the Kingdom of Salvation take me home?
Welcome to where time stands still  No one leaves and no one will  Moon is full, never seems to change  Just labeled mentally deranged  Dream the same thing every night  I see our freedom in my sight  No locked doors, no windows barred  No things to make my brain seem scarred   Sleep my friend and you will see  That dream is my reality  They keep me locked up in this cage  Can't they see it's why my brain says rage   Sanitarium, leave me be  Sanitarium, just leave me alone   Build my fear of what's out there  And cannot breathe the open air  Whisper things into my brain  Assuring me that I'm insane  They think our heads are in their hands  But violent use brings violent plans  Keep him tight, it makes him well  He's getting better, can't you tell?   No more can they keep us in  Listen, damn it, we will win  They see it right, they see it well  But they think this saves us from our hell   Sanitarium, leave me be  Sanitarium, just leave me alone  Sanitarium, just leave me alone   Fear of living on  Natives getting restless now  Mutiny in the air  Got some death to do  Mirror stares back hard  Kill, it's such a friendly word  Seems the only way  For reaching out again
You just stood there screaming,  Fearing no one was listening to you. They say the empty can rattles the most. The sound of your own voice must soothe you,  Hearing only what you want to hear,  And knowing only what you've heard. You, you're smothered in tragedy,  And you're out to save the world.  Misery,  You insist that the weight of the world  Should be on your shoulders. Misery,  There's much more to life than what you see,  My friend of misery.  You still stood there screaming,  No one caring about these words you tell. My friend, before your voice is gone,  One man's fun is another's hell,  These times are sent to try men's souls,  But something's wrong with all you see. You, you'll take it on all yourself,  Remember, misery loves company   Misery,  You insist that the weight of the world Should be on your shoulders. Misery,  There's much more to life than what you see,  My friend of misery, my friend of misery.  Misery,  You insist that the weight of the world  Should be on your shoulders. Misery,  There's much more to life than what you see,  My friend of misery,  You just stood there screaming. My friend of misery.

Guilty as charged But damn it, it ain't right. There's someone else controlling me,  Death in the air,  Strapped in the electric chair,  This can't be happening to me. Who made you God to say "I'll take your life from you!" Flash before my eyes,  Now it's time to die. Burning in my brain,  I can feel the flame. Wait for the sign,  To flick the switch of death,  It's the beginning of the end. Sweat chilling cold;  As I watch death unfold,  Consciousness my only friend. My fingers grip with fear,  What am I doing here? Flash before my eyes,  Now it's time to die,  Burning in my brain,  I can feel the flame. Someone help me,  Oh please, God help me,  They’re trying to take it all away,  I don't want to die. Someone help me,  Oh please, God help me They’re trying to take it all away,  I don't want to die. Time moving slow,  The minutes seem like hours. The final curtain all I see,  How true is this? Just get it over with,  If this is true, just let it be. Wakened by horrid scream,  Freed from this frightening dream. Flash before my eyes,  Now it's time to die,  Burning in my brain,  I can feel the flame.

Life it seems will fade away  Drifting further everyday  Getting lost within myself  Nothing matters no one else  I have lost the will to live  Simply nothing more to give  There is nothing more for me  Need the end to set me free   Things not what they used to be  Missing one inside of me  Deathly lost this can't be real  Can't stand this hell I feel  Emptiness is filling me  To the point of agony  Growing darkness taking dawn  I was me, but now he's gone   No one but me can save myself, but it's too late  Now I can't think, think why I should even try   Yesterday seems as though it never existed  Death greets me warm, now I will just say goodbye   Goodbye
Dear mother  Dear father What is this hell  You have put me through?   Believer, deceiver Day in, day out  Lived my life through you  Pushed onto me  What's wrong or right Hidden from this thing  That they call life  Dear mother  Dear father Every thought  I'd think you'd disapprove  Curator, dictator Always censoring  My every move  Children are seen  But are not heard Tear out everything inspired  Innocence  Torn from me  Without your shelter Barred reality I'm living blindly  Dear mother  Dear father Time has frozen still  What's left to be?  Hear nothing, say nothing Cannot face the fact  I think for me  No guarantee  It's life as is But damn you  For not giving me my chance  Dear mother  Dear father Clipped my wings  Before I learned to fly  Unspoiled, unspoken I've outgrown  That fucking lullaby  Same thing  I've always heard from you Do as I say  Not as I do  Innocence  Torn from me  Without your shelter Barred reality I'm living blindly  (Solo)  I'm in hell without you Cannot cope without you two Shocked at the world that I see Innocent victim  Please rescue me  Dear mother Dear father Hidden in your world  You've made for me  I'm seething I'm bleeding Ripping wounds in me  That never heal  Undying spite  I feel for you Living out this hell  You always knew...
