Unfortunately, Ian Stewart was not be able to revisit [kivy](https://kivy.org/), 
a Python framework for writing cross-platform applications. 
Instead we had a hands-on session (with Peter Reutemann's laptop/phone as the guinea pigs) 
on deploying applications on Android and how the [kivy-launcher 
project](https://github.com/kivy/kivy-launcher) can cut down on development time. 
kivy-launcher avoids having to compile your kivy projects to an APK beforehand using 
buildozer by launching them straight from source instead.
