There is frequently a need in Python code to access libraries for
various functionality not directly available in Python itself. These
libraries are often written for use from C or C++ code, not from
Python, so you need to create some kind of Python wrapper for them.
One common answer is to write an “extension module” in C or C++, using
the Python C API <https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/index.html>,
<https://docs.python.org/3/extending/index.html> to wrap the library
functionality in Python objects.

However, there is another approach, and that is to create the wrapper
entirely in Python, using the ctypes
<https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html> module. When I first
started reading about this, I assumed that it was a clunky solution
that should be used as a last resort -- that it would be preferable
in terms of usability, efficiency etc to go the extension-module
route, wherever possible.

However, I gradually found out that this is wrong. ctypes is actually
a very well-designed module, which can be used to create very
“Pythonic” wrappers -- that is, they behave as though the library
directly supports Python objects, with little or no hint that the
underlying library is actually implemented in C or C++, with no
thought for Python. In other words, using a ctypes wrapper can quite a
pleasant experience.

As an example, I am going to look at the Cairo graphics API
<https://www.cairographics.org/>, a powerful and versatile 2D graphics
engine. This has long had an “official” (?) Python binding, called
Pycairo <https://pycairo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>. This binding is
not a complete wrapper for the functionality of Cairo: there was no
upstream development for many years (between 2011 and 2017
<https://pycairo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html>), leaving it
with many gaps in its functionality. These have been mostly remedied
now, with the notable exception of fonts: there is still no support
for FreeType fonts
<https://www.cairographics.org/manual/cairo-FreeType-Fonts.html> or
user fonts
<https://www.cairographics.org/manual/cairo-User-Fonts.html>, and
another thing that continues to annoy me: no option to pass arguments
by keyword!

During this hiatus, I spent some time looking at filling in some of
these gaps, before deciding that it would be less effort to start
again from scratch.

So I created Qahirah <https://github.com/ldo/qahirah>, a pure-Python
binding for Cairo, using ctypes.

For comparison, Pycairo has about 10,000 lines of C code, while
qahirah.py is just about 8000 lines of Python code. The main omissions
from the latter are support for on-screen drawing through
platform-specific GUIs, but it has essentially everything else,
including all the font support. Plus I was able to add high-level
Python objects for Vector, Matrix, Colour and Path types. And being
pure Python, you get keyword arguments for free. It can also take
advantage of my pure-Python bindings for FreeType
<https://github.com/ldo/python_freetype/> and Fontconfig
<https://github.com/ldo/python_fontconfig/> if these are installed.

The way I like to think of Qahirah is: it’s what I think a graphics
API should look like if it was designed specifically for Python.

What are the supposed advantages of implementing
an extension module in compiled C/C++ code? As far as
I can tell, they are
* You can keep the insides of the module really private,
  whereas a Python module will always have its insides
  accessible from outside.
* Compiled code is more efficient than interpreted Python
  code.

I don’t see the first advantage as really much of an advantage. Guido
van Rossum, when asked why Python does not have visibility controls on
its modules and classes, replied “we’re all consenting adults here”.
Also, because a Python wrapper using ctypes does not completely lock
down its internal interface to the C library, it is possible, without
a great deal of effort, for users to resort to their own lower-level
accesses if they feel they need to, to handle situations that the
implementor of the wrapper did not envisage. This means
flexibility.

As for the efficiency issue, there may be libraries where it does
matter, but interfacing to Cairo is not one of them. Rendering graphics
means doing a lot of low-level pixel manipulation. So a lot of the CPU
time is spent inside the Cairo library doing just that, not in
interfacing to Python.

If you look at the Pycairo docs, the reason they give for not
supporting the additional font functionality is that “there is no open
source Python bindings [sic] to FreeType (and fontconfig) that
provides a C API”. Basically, they want another extension module for
Python that provides an API that allows the Pycairo extension module
to hook directly into it. They provide such a C API themselves
<https://pycairo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pycairo_c_api.html> to allow
other extension modules to interface with them. But it seems to me
this is an overcomplicated and unnecessary way of doing things.

Limitations of ctypes? only two major ones that I have found:
* Cannot pass a C struct by value, only by address
  (e.g. in Fontconfig, args of Value type -- thankfully not
  essential, there were alternative type-specific calls I was able
  to use)
* Cannot handle setjmp/longjmp -- required by libpng for
  its exception handling, which provides no other options
  for error notification besides setjmp/longjmp or aborting
  the program. This one leaves me stuck for now.
Another minor one: entry points have to have a fixed argument
signature, so it doesn’t seem to handle varargs routines well.
This hasn’t been a big deal for me for a couple of reasons:
* I rarely need to call such routines
* I figured out a hack to make copies of the entry-point object so
  each instance can be assigned a different argument signature.
