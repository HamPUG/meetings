## A Local /bin Directory

It is likely that when you log into an account on a Linux desktop computer it will run a .profile file that checks for the existence of a *bin* folder  off your home directory. If Python and Bash scripts with execute status are placed into this /bin directory, then these programs may be run from the bash prompt from anywhere within the users account.

This presentation demonstrates some of the advantages of creating a /bin folder. Also considered is how to have subdirectories off the /bin folder contain scripts that can also be executed.

With python programming one consideration is in which directory to place python modules you have created. This presentation demonstrates creating a library for python modules off the /bin directories and also creating ~/lib/python directory structure that is recognised as a local Python path. 

The presentation is available in two forms:

  * bin presentation.odp
  * bin presentation.pdf
